# Anomaly Detection in Credit Card Transactions

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. The model leverages logistic regression to identify anomalies in transaction data, enhancing fraud detection accuracy and security.

## Features
- **Anomaly Detection Model:** Developed and deployed a logistic regression model to detect fraudulent transactions.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Built a user-friendly Streamlit interface for real-time analysis and monitoring.
- **Enhanced Accuracy:** Leveraged AI/ML techniques to reduce false positives and improve fraud detection efficiency.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning Model:** Logistic Regression
- **Web Framework:** Streamlit
- **Database:** MySQL (optional for storing transaction data)

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Arun-reddy22/Mini-Project_Credit-Card-Fraud-detection-using-AI
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Streamlit app:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    
## Future Enhancements
- Implement deep learning models for improved detection.  
- Integrate real-time transaction data streams.  
- Deploy the system using cloud services.
